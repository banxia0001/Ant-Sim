    //TCP stands for transmission Control Protocol
    //It enables application programs and other computing devices to exchange messages over a network.
    //It's designed to send packets across the internet and allows for data and messages to be delivered over networks.
    //TCP is one of the most commonly used protocols used in network communications...
    //You can learn more about TCP here: https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/tcp-ip

    //Tutorial I used for this script:
    //https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG3VIUFcif0

    //BASIC SETUP/THINGS NOT EXPLAINED
    //YOU MUST INSTALL THE LATEST VERSION OF OBS
    //YOU MUST BE STREAMING TO HAVE CHAT OPEN TO TEST THINGS
